v2.0.0
re-factored GameLoop, removing lots of unnecessary methods
can accomplish the same functionality with far fewer methods
made gameLoop and renderer private in Engine and created separate DevEngine for development
DevEngine makes loop public and adds convenient render() method to start renderer but allow fine grain control over the loop

v2.0.1
forgot to export DevEngine from index.ts; fixed.

v3.0.0
simplified further
gameloop implementation was causing issues with dyanmic objects
will add step methods to individual objects instead
removed step and restart from gameLoop
renamed addEntity to add() in GameEngine
made loop and renderer public again so client can access individually
changed speed() to setRunRate() in GameLoop
