v2.0.0
re-factored GameLoop, removing lots of unnecessary methods
can accomplish the same functionality with far fewer methods
made gameLoop and renderer private in Engine and created separate DevEngine for development
DevEngine makes loop public and adds convenient render() method to start renderer but allow fine grain control over the loop

v2.0.1
forgot to export DevEngine from index.ts; fixed.
